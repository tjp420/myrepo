# Release v0.1.1 (2025-12-13)

Summary
-------

- Pinned and consolidated a minimal dev/test dependency manifest used by CI to make test runs deterministic.
- Added `pyproject.toml` so pip can perform an editable/local install (`-e .`) in CI.
- Added several test-only dependencies to the minimal pinned manifest discovered during fresh-venv smoke tests (examples: `httpx`, `jsonschema`, `aiohttp`, `cachetools`, `Pillow`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `psutil`, `scipy`).
- Fixed a pytest collection issue (adjusted `agi_chatbot/dev_shims.py`) that previously prevented tests from running in fresh environments.
- Exported a small `get_enhanced_framework` stub in `agi_chatbot/core/enhanced_answer.py` so tests can reliably monkeypatch the symbol when the real framework isn't available in CI.
- CI workflow updated to install the pinned minimal dev manifest and run the test suite; CI is now green for the changes introduced in this release.

Notes
-----

- The repository was made installable in CI by adding a minimal `pyproject.toml` (setuptools backend). This allows `-e .` in the pinned requirements to succeed in GitHub Actions.
- The change includes both developer/test tooling improvements and small, safe runtime shims to keep CI deterministic.
